Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.</p>

Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Recall from prior challenges how to filter data and map over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, but save the final average into the variable averageRating. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations.</p>

                                                        <h5>What is <code>str.replace(/[\W_]/g, '').toLowerCase()</code></h5>
                                                        <p>First, we want the argument (str) to replace everything that matches with /[\W_]/g with ''.</p>
                                                        <p>/[\W_]/g</p>
                                                        <p>\W Matches any character that is not a word character (alphanumeric & underscore)</p>
                                                        <p>_ matches with "_" character</p>
                                                        <p>g after the regex is a flag, there are many types of flags, and g is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp">flag</a> for global which  find all matches rather than stopping after the first match</p>
                                                        <h5>Now for <code>str.replace(/[\W_]/g, '').toLowerCase().split('').reverse().join('');</code>, its the same thing.</h5>
                                                        <p>The code will ignore the cases by using toLowerCase(), and then it will return true if its ===.</p>

What to do now? </h3><br><h5>You don't have to master 5 languages from the start, most programming language have same foundation, the only thing that is different is the syntax and you will be fine learning other languages after you master 1 language.</h5> <br><h4>Create a project. I recommend finishing all freecodecamp's project on responsive web and javascript's algorithm and data structure first since you will learn something like functional programming and regular expression, which needs a lot of practice to master, but has a very high reward after you understand and implement it.</h4>

                                    <h3>Tips to create a project.</h2><br><br>
                                    <p>HTML, CSS, Javascript are tools that we use to create something, everytime you want to create something, start with why, since it will become your motivation to not stressed out and have fun programming.</h3>
                                    <p>Done thinking? Now imagine you want to make a game, how will the system work? How do you want the system to work? And what needs to be done to make everything work? You write everything in a docs or a note.</p>
                                    <p>Great, now you know how the game works. Next step is to break everything down to little part, for example the characters, the place where the game is played, the scoring system, the skills of the characters, how the players will send an input, and every single thing. </p>
                                    <p>Things now starting to get clearer. Characters are variables, scoring system and skills are function, inputs are part of HTML.</p>
                                    <p>You also want to think logically on how it works, since you don't want to get stuck a year trying to make something that isnt well planned.</p>
