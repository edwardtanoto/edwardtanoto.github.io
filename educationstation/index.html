<br><h5>Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

</h5><br><code>moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]</code><br><br>
<p>
        <a href="https://codeburst.io/declarative-vs-imperative-programming-a8a7c93d9ad2"> Read this article on declarative and imperative programming</a><br>
     There are 2 ways to solve this challenge, an imperative way or declarative way, I'll start with the imperative way.
</p><br><br><p>First, notice the result. <code>returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]</code><br> We can separate two arrays, for example array that has zero and array with no zero, then we add the 2 arrays together.</p><br>
<p>We will iterate through the array to check if the value is zero or not, if its zero, we want to store it in array with other zeroes, and if it isnt zero, we want to store it in array with no zeroes, then we can just unite the 2 array together.</p>
<br><p>We add the array with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_concat_array.asp">concat</a> method</p>
<p>Here is the imperative solution:</p>
<code>
        var moveZeros = function (arr) {
      <br>  var result = [];<br>    
            var zeroes = [];
            <br>     &nbsp;&nbsp;    for(var i = 0;i<arr.length;i++){
                <br> <br>       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   if(arr[i] !== 0){ 
                    <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        result.push(arr[i]) 
                    <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       }
                    <br>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     else{ 
                        <br>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      zeros.push(arr[i]) 
              <br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    }
              <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;      }
              <br>     &nbsp;&nbsp;   return result.concat(zeros)
              <br>      }
</code><br><br><br>
<p>In the declarative solution, you write code that describes what you want, but not necessarily how to get it (declare your desired results, but not the step-by-step), what we want here is to put an array that has zeroes after array that has no zeroes.</p>
<p>Here is the declarative solution:</p>
<code>
     var moveZeros = function (arr) {
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;      return arr.filter(x=>x !== 0).concat(arr.filter(x=>x===0 ))
    <br>      }
</code><br><p>What this code does is simply find the element inside array, which is x, that isnt zero, and concat it to another array which is an array with zeroes.</p>

Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.</p>

Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Recall from prior challenges how to filter data and map over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, but save the final average into the variable averageRating. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations.</p>

What to do now? </h3><br><h5>You don't have to master 5 languages from the start, most programming language have same foundation, the only thing that is different is the syntax and you will be fine learning other languages after you master 1 language.</h5> <br><h4>Create a project. I recommend finishing all freecodecamp's project on responsive web and javascript's algorithm and data structure first since you will learn the basic and something like functional programming and regular expression, which needs a lot of practice to master, but has a very high reward after you understand and implement it.</h4>

                                    <h3>Tips to create a project.</h2><br><br>
                                    <p>HTML, CSS, Javascript are tools that we use to create something, everytime you want to create something, start with why, since it will become your motivation to not stressed out and have fun programming.</h3>
                                    <p>Done thinking? Now imagine you want to make a game, how will the system work? How do you want the system to work? And what needs to be done to make everything work? You write everything in a docs or a note.</p>
                                    <p>Great, now you know how the game works. Next step is to break everything down to little part, for example the characters, the place where the game is played, the scoring system, the skills of the characters, how the players will send an input, and every single thing. </p>
                                    <p>Things now starting to get clearer. Characters are variables, scoring system and skills are function, inputs are part of HTML.</p>
                                    <p>You also want to think logically on how it works, since you don't want to get stuck a year trying to make something that isnt well planned.</p>
