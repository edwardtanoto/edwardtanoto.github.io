                                    <p>HTML, CSS, Javascript are tools that we use to create something, everytime you want to create something, start with why, since it will become your motivation to not stressed out and have fun programming.</h3>
                                    <p>Done thinking? Now imagine you want to make a game, how will the system work? How do you want the system to work? And what needs to be done to make everything work? You write everything in a docs or a note.</p>
                                    <p>Great, now you know how the game works. Next step is to break everything down to little part, for example the characters, the place where the game is played, the scoring system, the skills of the characters, how the players will send an input, and every single thing. </p>
                                    <p>Things now starting to get clearer. Characters are variables, scoring system and skills are function, inputs are part of HTML.</p>
                                    <p>You also want to think logically on how it works, since you don't want to get stuck a year trying to make something that isnt well planned.</p>
