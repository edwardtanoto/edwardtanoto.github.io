## About Me

Hello, world! I'm Edward, a Computer Science student in the University of Nottingham Ningbo and a passionate programmer. 

I'm here to help making a change, to learn more, and to make code beyond than just binaries.

I am here to tell you that every lines of code I type in a computer, every zeros and ones which forms pixels, which later forms colours in our computers, which later forms websites, which later sends your message to the world. 

I am here to tell you that it never was about the binaries, it's always about making it become more than binaries.

## Goals that I have in life

### Making code beyond binaries through ideas and creativity

[Bill Gates](https://singjupost.com/bill-gates-commencement-speech-at-harvard-2007-full-transcript/) once said "But humanity’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity."

Codes and entrepreneurship could make the modern world a better place.

### Building a startup

One of the many things I learned after watching Silicon Valley HBO, its that, startups change the world. Building a team, doing SCRUM for works, eating pizza and codes, start a fundraising, getting sued by competitors, getting fired in your own company by the majority of shareholders, keep inventing new ideas and work to your goals, and finally change the world, okay that went really bad for a second.

It is undeniable that startup have a really high chances of failures. My chance building unicorn company is lower than getting strucked by lightning, but it doesn't change the facts that startups change the world. Technology grows really fast, and I want to be the part that contributes to the future.

### Work in one of the Big 4/ Big 5

Mentioning each of their contributions here is not enough. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, working with them are the dreams of every programmer. Every programmer and majority of human society. 

The only (-) I see here is probably just because I don't think I'll ever quit a job in these companies, I have huge affection for Google which always be there when I debug something. I would solve this by build some startups and build some experiences before having worthy value for them.

The (+) is everything else. Great environment to work, free lunch, high paying jobs, I can add it on my resume, and a lot of other things.

## Values I can give as human being

### Tutoring

[Mark Zuckeberg](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/mark-zuckerbergs-speech-as-written-for-harvards-class-of-2017/) once said 
"But it’s not just about money. You can also give time. I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week — that’s all it takes to give someone a hand, to help them reach their potential." on his Harvard speech, you can search Mark Zuckeberg Harvard speech transcript, as a credibility.

That speech was probably refering to the CS Harvard graduates, but yeah it doesn't really change the message.
We love to talk about making a world a better place, but better place means better people as well. If I could help someone learn something in the field of computers, I want to help them. It will take some time, but no one become good in 1 night.

I put my learning sources and some introduction to code in [here](https://edwardtanoto.github.io/educationstation/index.html) 

### Problem Solving Skills

One thing I learn from programming is, you spent 10% of your time to code, and 90% to figure what is wrong with your code.
Good news is, most programmers are already used to this situation, we learn. We are used to solving problems by splitting it into small pieces, figure out what is wrong, and solve it. For CS students, its basically merge sort algorithm. 

### Leadership skills

Programming is literally giving computer set of instructions to do a task. 
But computers and humans are different, the difference between humans and computers are their creativity. So, basically everything.

Each people have talents and each computers have processors. For example, Justin Bieber can sing, but he can't read 01111000 01100100 like [some people](https://www.thetoptens.com/singers-who-use-auto-tune/) which does the same thing, singing in auto-tune software. Nevermind, I think he reads 01111000 01100100 better than some people. But the point remains that computers are different than humans. You just don't shout zero zero seven to people and expect them to understand all those numbers. 

Leadership in general is a skill to influence people. 

In my opinion, leadership is about building a chemistry in a team that is so high that you become love working with them.

### Communication Skills

Have I sucessfully make reading not boring?
