 Language is a communication tools that is used to interact with others.<br/> English is my most comfortable global language to speak with people. I speak anime language a little bit as well, I had some backgrounds of Japanese in my high school, although I won't speak Japanese in public, but I would be glad to speak it whenever necessary. As for Mandarin, I speak it for daily life only, so I won't have any clue when people tell me to check for missing codes in Chinese, but I understand when they want to eat cheeseburger. I believe the best way to work with people is to make a positive environment and be honest in good or bad situation, and work together for the long term goals.

<p style="margin-top:100px;">I am very excited to be in the part of the world that will create the future. Imagine in couple years in the future , we probably live in the cyberpunk era. The building probably won't look the same as sci-fi story, well some people will never leave their room anyway, but still, everything else is on the internet. Coffee machines, transportation, communication and etc. I have interested in computer since elementary school, I used to game a lot back then, but now I am mostly learn and create fun things . I want to contribute to the world behind the screen, for the sake of the mankind and to build my gaming computer too.</p>

This is the original project I have remade after I learnt javascript. 
<ul>
  <li>First on every project, I always create a txt file to summarize how the game will work and how I will make it work.</li>
  <li>The nature of this game is a mind game, which means I have to hide what chars I will play, so I change the input type to password to hide the chars. Then, I create javascript code so I can reveal the hidden chars in a click.</li>
  <li>I've also found that its very important to know what to do code before do the code, my game has a lot of characters which have each unique skills, it is important to think realistically on how each char works.</li>
  <li>I have to create data structures for each char to make the score system works. </li>
  <li>Each char has their own array which holds property to hold the char value, such as "K", "Q", etc, and points of each chars, for example Pawn has 1 point if alone</li>
  <li>The game would be very boring if there is no interesting skills or combos, so I wrote the function that loops for the input, and create if elses condition for the combos to work, and manipulate the points inside the data structures if certain conditions are true.</li>
  <li>Some skills are based upon the opponent's input, which makes it more challenging to code.</li>
  <li>After couple hours of coding and testing the function, it finally works and then I am working on the input.</li>
  <li>I have P1 and P2, but my function only loop the input of P1 input, and thus the function cant declare a winner.</li>
  <li>So I create the same loop but for P2, and I created variables to hold the score1 and score2 data for each players</li>
  <li>After I done testing by doing console.log everything I input and check the score, all that left is how to declare the winner. </li>
  <li>Declaring the winner only took some if elses statement, then change the value of the input with document.getElementbyId("name").value==win/lose/draw</li>
  <li>Now it looks like everything is done, the score system and declaring winner system for each round is done, there is something missing, the most important part of this board game</li>
  <li>At this point I only develop the game itself, and not the code.</li>
  <li>I added maxlength="4" to each input, but I didnt add minlength="4", Why ?</li>
  <li>If every input of P1 and P2 is not 4, then certain combos are very easy to guess, which might be good for a mindgame, but this is the interesting part, I introduce the "bluffing mechanic", which means you can add unrelated letters to confuse your opponents by writing 4 letters in input, but in reality you've only put 2 chars in the input, and the game is based on round system, so it would be unfair for the first player if they get countered so easily.</li>
  <li>The round system will make the game more balanced, because the next round, each players can guess which combos the other player will play, and which combos are no longer available.</li>
  <li>I was very excited when the code works, but the project might only have future after I created the mobile version, or make it online, and it is happening later. </li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top:120px;">I have built 2 website before this, but this one is the most developed one, other websites were just built for some practice. I study javascript and python from many sources as a self-taught learner. I learnt most of them from youtube and sites like <a href="www.freecodecamp.com"> freecodecamp</a> ,<a href="www.edx.com">edX</a> and <a href="www.sololearn.com">sololearn</a> which I found helpful. I also have experience using source control like github, obviously, and I understand other languages like Swift and PHP as well.
  I also believe that creating some projects and side projects are the best way to learn how to code, and I will always use the internet as my source to learn and my place to contribute.
