First thought
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought about this idea when I was at highschool, I wanted to make a fun game that peoples can play with their friends, so I created a new boardgame. I thought alot of things, what make a game boring and what make a game fun, and so I create the skills to make characters not boring, not just value of each characters beat other characters, but something different that would make games fun to play.

Problems making it
        </p>
        At first I thought it isn't possible to make a game like this without using java or javascript, my idea was making icons representing each characters and make them draggable to each areas, then the program would calculate which player have the higher points, but since I haven't learn that deep into java or javascript, I don't understand how to write that kind of code. I thought this boardgame might be similiar with chess programming, such as each character has their each points, and can capture one another, but I still can't implemented it into the codes.
      </li>

Way I solve it
        </p>
        <p>
        I thought another way without using java or javascript to make variables and calculations, by simply using html and create 2 input for each players,the input has password type to hide the letters of characters,and  1 input for the players to write which players win the area,then a show 'area' checkboxes, which is show password code, and let 2 players show their chosen characters and manually take score it. But it would be obvious how many the quantities of characters each players in every areas, so I added rule, like you can add unrelated letter to the input that confuse the enemy team, which solved the problem.
